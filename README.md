This is log4j 1.2.x being resuscitated under the name "reload4j".

As End of Life (EOL) status of log4j 1.x was formally reaffirmed on
January the 6th 2022, and given the need to fix critical issues in
log4j 1.2.17, and the presence of several volunteers to do the work,
it was decided to resuscitate log4j 1.x under the name "reload4j" as a
drop-in replacement.

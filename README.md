## What is reload4j?

The reload4j project is a fork of Apache log4j version 1.2.17. It aims to 
fix the most urgent issues in log4j 1.2.17 which hasn't seen a new release 
since 2012. It will be a drop-in replacement for __log4j.jar__.

Note that End of Life (EOL) status of log4j 1.x was formally reaffirmed on
January the 6th 2022, and given the need to fix critical issues in
log4j 1.2.17, and the presence of several volunteers to do the work,
it was decided to resuscitate log4j 1.x under the name "reload4j" as a
drop-in replacement.
